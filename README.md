editor
======

This hobby project is about making a Vim-like editor in Go. 

Current goals
-------------

* It should support popular Vim features.
* Being fast _enough_, even for large files.
* Simple install and config. Users should be able to `go get` and type away on
  all platfoms!
* Plugins should be easy to implement in Go.

Non-goals
---------

* Vimscript support.
* Running the UI separately from the main process, rendering on the GPU, etc.

Status
------

It doesn't work yet.
